# (CCN 2023) Valiant Neuroidal Model Simulation
by Patrick Perrine and Chandradeep Chowdhury

This repository was published in conjunction with the following publication submission:

Rwebangira, M., Perrine, P., and Chowdhury C. (2023, August). Capacity in Valiantâ€™s Neuroidal Model for Shared Memory Representations. *Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience 2023*.

This repository primarily hosts a documented Python Notebook containing our simulation code and some sample output. Our results were computed on an instance of Google Colab.
